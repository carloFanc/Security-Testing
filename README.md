# Security-Testing

This project consists in analyzing the php code of an ecommerce platform called Inventory-Management-System. Then, the Pixy tool was used to detect XSS vulnerabilities and classify them True Positive or False Positive. For True Positive cases are written automated test cases using the Selenium tool to assert the presence of the vulnerabilities. Finally, the vulnerabilities have been fixed and using the already used automated test case it is asserted that the fixes are effective. The testing has been implemented using the IDE Eclipse, JUnit and Selenium. As required by the project specification, the Taint Analysis was performed with the Pixy tool, which tries to detect two major types of web application XSS vulnerabilities and SQL injection. In this case, the tool has been found only the XSS vulnerabilities.
